<h3>Math Learning Goals</h3>

<p>Students will:</p>
<ul>
<li>Connect the meaning of the denominator of a fraction to the number of equal partitions between 0 and 1 on a number line</li>
<li>Represent fractions on a number line, using benchmarks to check precise and approximate placements, in order to compare and order the fractions</li>
</ul>

<h3>Materials</h3>

</ul>


<h4>Minds On…</h4>
<h5>Whole Class  Guided Activity</h5>
<p>Construct a number line from 0 to 1 on the board. Tell students that they will be placing the fractions <abbr title="one half">½</abbr>, <abbr title="one fourth">¼</abbr>,
<abbr title="two fourths">2&frasl;4</abbr>, <abbr title="three fourths">¾</abbr>, <abbr title="three eighths">3&frasl;8</abbr>, <abbr title="one fifth">1/5</abbr>, <abbr title="sixteen twentieths">16&frasl;20</abbr>, <abbr title="two thirds">2&frasl;3</abbr> on the number line. Have a student select one of the fractions to label on the number line in the appropriate location. Probe their understanding using the following prompts:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Why did you select that fraction to place?</li>
    <li>What was your reasoning for placing it where you did?</li>
    <li>What strategy might you use to decide if the fraction is closer to 0, <abbr title="one half">½</abbr> or a whole number?</li>
    <li>What was ______ doing as s/ he figured out where to position <abbr title="four fifths">4&frasl;5</abbr>? How was that reasoning helpful?</li>
    <li>How is finding the halfway point helpful? Are there other benchmark fractions that were helpful to you?</li>
</ul>
<p>Continue with different students until all fractions are placed. It may be necessary to remind students that they should be dividing the number line into the same number of spaces as the denominator and that it may be useful to consider benchmarks to help place unusual fractions.</p>

<h4>Action!</h4>
<h5>Small Group  Practice Activity</h5>
<p>Using large pieces of paper,students create three same length number lines, labeled as indicated in <abbr title="Blackline Master">BLM</abbr> 1.1. Ask students to place the corresponding fractions on the number line. They must be prepared to justify their thinking as to why they placed it there.
Probe student thinking with the following prompts:</p>

<ul>
<li>How did you decide where it went?</li>
<li>Is there a unit fraction that would help you place this fraction more accurately?</li>
<li>Is your fraction more than 1 or less than 1?</li>
<li>Compare your number lines with a different group. Explain your reasoning why you placed the fractions where you did.</li>
<li>What strategies did you use to decide where the fraction should be placed?</li>
</ul>

<h3>Minds On…</h3>
<h4>Individual  Match Activity</h4>
<p>Students use 0.5, 0.75, 0.25, 1.0, <abbr title="three fourhts">¾</abbr>, <abbr title="one half">½</abbr>, 1, <abbr title="one fourth">¼</abbr>
To match the fractions with their equivalent decimal representations.
Probe student thinking using the following prompts:</p>
<ul>
<li>Why did you put those two together?</li>
<li>How do you know they have the same value / or they represent the same amount?</li>
<li>Explain a connection to fair sharing, money or to a manipulative.</li>
</ul>

<h4>Pairs  Activity</h4>
<p>Students place the previous set of fractions and decimals on a number line labelled from 0 to 1. Probe student thinking using the following prompts:</p>
<ul>
<li>What was your reasoning for placing the numbers there?</li>
<li>What strategy might you use to decide if the decimal card is closer to 0 or 1?</li>
<li>What was ____ doing as s/he figured out where to place 0.75? How did that reasoning help ____?</li>
<li>How is finding the halfway point helpful?</li>
</ul>

<h3>Action!</h3>
<h4>Pairs  Activity</h4>
<p>Consider whether it is more appropriate to pair students as: strong/strong and weak/weak, or weak/strong for this activity. Provide pairs with a copy of <abbr title="Blackline Master">BLM</abbr> 2.1. Circulate and ask probing questions where you detect misunderstanding, confusion, or lack of detail. Encourage early finishers to try a second choice in question 2. Decide whether or not there is value in whole class discussion of question 1.</p>

<h4>Whole Class  Malk Learning Community</h4>
<p>Ask an appropriate pair to present their thinking about question 2A, encouraging classmates to question statements and illustrations they do not understand. Repeat for 2B and 2C.</p>
<p>Note that all fractions in 2A and 2B are all equivalent, but not so in 2C.</p>

<h3>Consolidate Debrief</h3>
<h4>Individual  Exit Card</h4>
<p>Record your response to the following prompt. You will be asked to hand this in before leaving.
Frank now thinks that <abbr title="one fourth">¼</abbr>
, 0.5 and <abbr title="four sixteenths">4&frasl;16</abbr> would all be placed in the same location on the number line. Do you agree or disagree? Explain your thinking in more than one way.
This can be assessed using the following criteria. Does the student:</p>
<ul>
    <li>understand that the three numbers do not all represent the same amount?</li>
    <li>convert between fractions and decimals?</li>
    <li>use manipulatives and/or diagrams to support their thinking?</li>
    <li>make connections to benchmarks and/or real life situations (<abbr title="For example">e.g.</abbr>
 money, <abbr title="one half">½<?)?</li>

<h3>Math Learning Goals</h3>
<p>Students will:</p>
<ul>
    <li>reason as they place fractions and decimals on a number line</li>
    <li>connect different representations of the same number</li>
    <li>communicate their rationale, including their use of benchmark numbers</li>

</ul>

<h3>Minds On…</h3>
<h4>Whole Class  Matching Activity</h4>
<p>Each student receives one card and circulates amongst classmates to match the numerical value of their representation to three other students in the room. Once completed correctly, each group will have a hundreds grid, fraction card, decimal number and hundredths card representing the same number.</p>

<h4>Small Groups  Discussion</h4>
<p>Once groups have been formed, students share the card they have and everything they notice about their card.
Sentence starters include:</p>
<ul>
    <li>I think my card belongs here because …</li>
    <li>I see how my representation connects to _____’s card because …</li>
    <li>My representation is the similar to _____’s because …</li>
    <li>My representation is different than _____’s since …</li>
    <li>Something I noticed about all four representations is …</li>
</ul>

<p>Cards can be found on page 51 of The Guide to Effective Instruction (<abbr title="Volume">Vol</abbr>. 6); 7 sets makes a class of 28 in groups of 4; see <abbr title="page">pg.</abbr> 59-63 in the Guide for more details.</p>


<h3>Action!</h3>
<h4>Pairs  Activity</h4>
<p>Provide students with a set of cards (<abbr title="Blackline Master">BLM</abbr> 3.1). Have them place each card on a number line. Inform them that they will be required to justify their reasoning.</p>
<p>Circulate to support and extend student understanding using the following types of questions:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Which number representations do you know and recognize?</li>
    <li>What strategies could you use to place the other ones?</li>
    <li>How can you use benchmarks to help you place some of the other ones?</li>
    <li>Which representations show the same amount?</li>
    <li>Is there a fraction that is close to 1?</li>
    <li>Is there a fraction that is close to 0?</li>
</ul>
<p>Provide students with a mixture of representations (fractions, decimals, hundreds grid, hundredths card) In pairs students place these on a number line- justifying their reasoning.</p>
<p><abbr title="fifty one hundredths">50/100</abbr>, <abbr title="one half">½</abbr>,.5, <abbr title="eighty one hundredths">80&frasl;100</abbr>, <abbr title="four fifths">4&frasl;5</abbr>, .8 <abbr title="five twenty-fifths">5&frasl;25</abbr>, (need to add other numbers)</p>

<h2>Unit Ordering Fractions: Day 4:</h2>

<p>60 <abbr title="minutes">min</abbr></p>
<h3>Math Learning Goals</h3>
<p>Students will:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Investigate relationships among fractions, decimals and percentages</li>
    <li>reason about the connection between the intervals on the number line and the denominator</li>
</ul>


<h3>Minds On…</h3>
<h4>Individual  Math Journal</h4>
<p>Students respond to this prompt:
“What is the relationship between fractions, decimals and percentages?”</p>
<p><a href="http://illuminations.nctm.org/LessonDetail.aspx?id=L784">Comparing and Ordering Number Lines:</a>


<h3>Action!</h3>
<h4>Pairs  Activity</h4>
<p>Instruct students to draw two number lines and then place the numbers in the proper place.</p>
<ol>
    <li>0, 1, 50%, 75%, <abbr title="four eighths">4/8</abbr>, 0.50, 0.25, 40%</li>

</ol>

<p>If students are struggling it may be helpful to ask them what strategies they have used in previous lessons to order numbers and to determine equivalency between the different number systems (fractions, decimals and percentages).</p>

<h3>Consolidate Debrief</h3>
<h4>Whole Class  Anchor Chart</h4>
<p>Create an anchor chart which highlights key properties of each number system (<abbr title="For example">e.g.</abbr>
, % means ‘out of 100’, 0.5 is read ‘five tenths’ so it is a fraction with a denominator of 10) and outlines strategies for comparison/conversion between fractions, percentages and decimals.</p>


<h3>Practice</h3>
<h4>Home Activity or Further Classroom Consolidation</h4>
<p>Students complete textbook questions that require them to convert between fractions, decimals and percentages.</p>
