<h2>Use unit fractions to name and count fractional amounts</h2>

<p>Using unit fractions (<abbr title="For example">e.g.</abbr>
, one one-seventh, two one-sevenths, <abbr title="etcetera">etc.</abbr>) when counting fractional amounts, such as regions in a rectangle, rather than using a whole number count (<abbr title="For example">e.g.</abbr>
, 1, 2 ,3 ...), reinforces the meaning of the fraction. </p>

<h3>Background</h3>

<p>A unit fraction is the base unit of any fraction and always has a numerator of 1; for example, <abbr title="one fourth">¼</abbr>, <abbr title="one fifth">1&frasl;5</abbr>, <abbr title="one twenty-third">1&frasl;23</abbr> are all unit fractions. Every fraction can be decomposed into unit fractions. For example, <abbr title="three fourths">¾</abbr> is 3 one-fourth units (so one fourth is the unit</p> fraction and we are thinking about 3 of them). Partitioning a model involves determining and creating a unit fraction.

<p>Consider the fraction one and three-fourths. This number can be decomposed using a unit fraction.</p>

<p>seven one-fourths units
<p>One and two-fourths can be composed using a unit fraction.</p>

<p>One and two-fourths can be composed using a unit fraction.</p>

<p> A student may say, “One whole is the same as 4 one-fourth units. I added another 2 one-fourth units to the whole to obtain 6 one-fourth units. So I can see that 6 one-fourth units is equal to one and two-fourths. </p>

<p>Use of unit fractions supports a deeper understanding of quantity. Notice that in the student dialogue above, early understanding of equivalency is being developed, <abbr title="that is">i.e.</abbr>, one and one half is the same as six fourths. Counting by naming the unit fractions helps students to see the parts of the fraction when composing and decomposing. Notice that both counting unit fractions and composing and decomposing fractions are pre-cursors to addition and subtraction. For example, composing 6 one-fourth units is the same as adding 6 one-fourth units together to make one and one half.</p>

<h3>Tasks</h3>

<h4>Counting Game</h4>

<p>Students “count up” using unit fractions (for example, <abbr title="one fourth">¼</abbr>, <abbr title="one third">1&frasl;3</abbr>, <abbr title="one half">½</abbr>, <abbr title="one eighth">1&frasl;8</abbr> , <abbr title="etcetera">etc.</abbr>). The students or teacher can choose any unit fractions, and the teacher or students can set game rules such as: "When you get to one whole, stand up and state the quantity as both a fraction and as a whole". Note: this game is similar to a well-known number game called BUZZ.</p>
