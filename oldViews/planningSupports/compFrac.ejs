            algorithms).</li>

        <li>develop an understanding of equivalent fractions as meaning ‘different names for the same fraction/numeric value’.</li>
        <li>view a fraction as a numerical value by considering the part and whole simultaneously. Note that use of the algorithm
            of dividing or multiplying the numerator and denominator by the same number reinforces the notion of fraction
            as being comprised of two whole numbers rather than representing a single value.</li>
        <li>reason through a problem.</li>
        <li>make a strong connection between the question and their answer/solution as students are more likely to trust
            an incorrect answer generated from an algorithm than their own reasoning.</li>
        <li>demonstrate their prior knowledge, which teachers can then build upon.</li>
