<section id="infoParagraph">
<p>The purpose of this interactive planning tool for teaching fractions is to provide educators with a
research informed framework. It includes a range of field-tested tasks (grades 3-10) that have proven
to be effective in Ontario schools. The collection of tasks follows a logical sequence that can be modified
and/or adjusted to fit teacher and student needs. Video and photos are also included to bring the learning
to life. This interactive planning tool also includes one page summaries of key fractions math ideas as well
as anticipation guides that feature Ontario studentsâ€™ thinking.</p>
