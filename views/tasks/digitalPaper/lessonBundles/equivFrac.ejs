    <li>communicate strengths of different representations for different students and in certain contexts <abbr title="For example">e.g.</abbr>

        <h4>Pairs  Parallel Task (15 <abbr title="minutes">min</abbr>)</h4>
        Ask students to select one of the following fractions: <abbr title="four tenths">4&frasl;10</abbr> or <abbr title="two fifths">2&frasl;5</abbr>, and represent it in as many ways as they canr. Pairs display all of their representations in their workspace.

        <h4>Whole Group  Gallery Walk (10 <abbr title="minutes">min</abbr>)</h4>
        Students circulate around the room and review the different representations. Students consider which representation they think most clearly shows the fraction, and indicate their preference by placing a sticky note with their name by their first choice. Ask students to be prepared to discuss any similarities or differences they notice between the representations of <abbr title="four tenths">4&frasl;10</abbr> and <abbr title="two fifths">2&frasl;5</abbr>.
        </td>
        <td>
        Teachers can provide scaffolding by suggesting different manipulatives for different pairs.
        Students may notice that the two fractions are equivalent. Allow them to reason and explore to reach this conclusion.

        <h4>Whole Group  Discussion</h4>
        <p>Organize and name the different types of representations students preferred. Ask students who put their name on a sticky note by each particular representation to explain why they think that one is the most effective. Use prompts such as:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>What did you see?</li>
            <li>What did you like?</li>
            <li>I am noticing a lot of students selected (this) model. Why do you think so many of us chose that representation?</li>
            <li>Why didn’t you pick (the most popular)?</li>
            <li>I am interested in this representation…. (least picked)</li>
            <li>One of my favourite representations of <abbr title="two fifths">2/5</abbr> is (show a representation that students did not show <abbr title="For example">e.g.</abbr>
, position on a number line). Why do you think I like this type of representation?</li>
        </ul>

        <p>Push their thinking for each representation by using some of the following questions:</p>
        <h5>Key Questions:</h5>
        <ul>
            <li>So what does the 4 (2) represent?</li>
            <li>What does the 10 (5) represent?</li>
            <li>How are the 4 and the 10 (2 and 5) related?</li>
            <li>Why is it important for this to be partitioned into equal parts?</li>
            <li>What do equal parts mean in this model?</li>
        </ul>

        <h4>Independent  Math Log</h4>
        <p>Use another colour of ink to build on your note in your Math Log. Be sure to include at least one example of each type of representation that shows your understanding of a fraction.</p>
