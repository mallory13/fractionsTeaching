        <p>In K through Grade3, students develop their understanding of fraction through:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>dividing whole objects and sets of objects into equal-sized parts and naming using fractional names</li>
            <li>comparing common fractional areas (e.g., onehalf and one-fourth)</li>
            <li>composing fractional values by combining fractional pieces</li>
            <li>use of fractional names but not formal fraction notation</li>
        </ul>

        <ul>
            <li>represent fractions using concrete materials, words, and standard fractional notation, and explain the meaning
                of the denominator as the number of the fractional parts of a whole or a set, and the numerator as the
                number of fractional parts being considered;</li>
            <li>compare and order fractions (i.e., halves, thirds, fourths, fifths, tenths) by considering the size and the
                number of fractional parts (e.g., 4/5 is greater than 3/5 because there are more parts in 4/5; ¼ is greater
                than 1/5 because the size of the part is larger in ¼);</li>
            <li>compare fractions to the benchmarks of 0, ½ and 1 ( e.g., 1/8 is closer to 0 than ½; 3/5 is more than ½);</li>
            <li>demonstrate and explain the relationship between equivalent fractions, using concrete materials (e.g., fraction
                circles, fraction strips, pattern blocks) and drawings;</li>
            <li>count forward by halves, thirds, fourths, and tenths to beyond one whole, using concrete materials and number
                lines (e.g., use fraction circles to count fourths: “One fourth, two fourths, three fourths, four fourths,
                five fourths, six fourths, …”);</li>
            <li>determine and explain, through investigation, the relationship between fractions (i.e., halves, fifths, tenths)
                and decimals to tenths, using a variety of tools (e.g., concrete materials, drawings, calculators) and
                strategies (e.g., decompose 2/5 into 4/10 by dividing each fifth into two equal part to show that 2/5
                can be represented as 0.4).</li>

                and mixed numbers, using a variety of tools (e.g., fraction circles, Cuisenaire rods, number lines) and
                using standard fractional notation;</li>
            <li>demonstrate and explain the concept of equivalent fractions, using concrete materials (e.g., use fraction
                strips to show that ¾ is equal to 9/12);</li>
            <li>describe multiplicative relationships between quantities by using simple fractions and decimals (e.g., “If
                you have 4 plums and I have 6 plums, I can say that I have 1 ½ or 1.5 times as many plums as you have.”);</li>
            <li>determine and explain, through investigation using concrete materials, drawings, and calculators, the relationship
                between fractions (i.e., with denominators of 2, 4, 5, 10, 20, 25, 50, and 100) and their equivalent
                decimal forms (e.g., use a 10 x 10 grid to show that 2/5 = 40/100, which can also be represented as 0.4);</li>
            <li>demonstrate an understanding of simple multiplicative relationships involving whole-number rates, through
                investigation using concrete materials and drawings (Sample problem: If 2 books cost $6, how would you
                calculate the cost of 8 books?).</li>
